# AI IT Helper App

## Quick Overview

An Open Source Electron desktop app that monitors your Slack DMs and tech support channels, showing incoming IT requests in a queue where you can select messages to send to AI for automated responses or suggested replies. The app keeps you in control by letting you review and edit AI responses before they're sent, while handling 70-80% of routine IT questions like password resets, VPN issues, and software installation requests. This reduces interruptions during deep work while ensuring team members get fast, accurate help for common problems.

## Problem Statement

As a senior DevOps engineer at a scaling startup, I'm constantly interrupted by basic IT helpdesk questions via Slack DMs and tech request channels. This slows down my core work and creates bottlenecks for the team.

## Solution Overview

An Electron desktop application that monitors Slack communications and provides AI-assisted responses to common IT questions, allowing me to maintain control while dramatically reducing response time.

## Core Features

### Message Monitoring  

- Monitor Slack DMs and designated tech support channels
- Real-time message queue with previews
- Smart filtering to identify tech-related requests
- Context preservation (thread history, user info)

### AI-Assisted Response System

- Select messages to send to AI for processing
- Two response modes:
  - **Auto-response**: AI crafts and sends response directly
  - **Suggestion mode**: AI provides draft response for editing
- Pre-built prompts for common IT scenarios
- Integration with company knowledge base and procedures

### User Interface

- Split-pane design: message queue (left) + AI response panel (right)
- Quick action buttons: "Auto-respond", "Get suggestion", "Ignore", "Escalate"
- Editable response box with send/cancel options
- Message categorization and filtering
- Focus mode (snooze notifications during deep work)

## Technical Architecture

### Platform

- **Frontend**: Electron with modern web technologies
- **Backend**: Node.js for Slack API integration
- **AI Integration**: Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic

### Key Integrations

- Slack Web API / Socket Mode for real-time messaging
- Company documentation (Confluence, Notion, internal wikis)
- Ticketing system (Jira, ServiceNow) for escalation
- Calendar integration for availability status

### Data Flow

1. Slack message received → filtered for tech content
2. Message added to queue with context
3. User selects message → sends to AI with company context
4. AI returns response/suggestion → user reviews/edits
5. Response sent back through Slack → ticket closed or escalated

## Common Use Cases

### Auto-Response Scenarios

- Password reset instructions
- VPN setup guides
- Software installation procedures
- Account access requests
- Basic troubleshooting steps

### Suggestion Mode Scenarios

- Complex technical issues requiring personalization
- Requests involving specific company policies
- Multi-step procedures needing customization
- Escalation decisions

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP

- Basic Slack message monitoring
- Simple AI integration with OpenAI API
- Manual message selection and response
- Core UI with message queue and response panel

### Phase 2: Intelligence

- Smart message filtering and categorization
- Company knowledge base integration
- Response templates and learning from edits
- Auto-response for common scenarios

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- Local AI model option (Ollama integration)
- Advanced analytics and response effectiveness
- Multiple channel support (Teams, email)
- Workflow automation and ticket routing

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in manual response time
- Increase in first-response resolution rate
- Decreased interruption frequency during focus work
- User satisfaction scores from team members

## Technical Requirements

- Node.js runtime for Electron app
- Slack workspace admin permissions for bot creation
- AI API access (OpenAI) or local GPU for model hosting
- 8GB+ RAM for potential local AI models

## Security Considerations

- Secure API key management
- Message content encryption in transit
- Option to use local AI models for sensitive data
- Audit logging for all AI-generated responses

## Getting Started

1. Set up Slack bot with appropriate permissions
2. Create basic Electron app structure
3. Implement Slack API integration for message monitoring
4. Build simple UI for message queue and AI interaction
5. Integrate AI API with company-specific prompts
6. Test with common IT scenarios and iterate
